# Logbook

## Week 3
### Tue 12 April
* Got assigned a project


### Wo 13 April
* Meeting with Stratis, discussed general project/ first steps. Need to find dataset! Received material/links to study.
* Watched RNN lecture
* Setup GitHub
* Created logbook

### Thu 14 April
* Searched for literature regarding RNN's, LSTM's and GRU's
* Looked for possible datasets
* New idea: instead of using music with differing genres, use discography's by different artists. The extra input unit would then correspond to the artist that the network is currently training. This should only require a different dataset (and maybe a different input vector).
* Created first draft of problem definition

### Fri 15 April
* Attended presentation session with Karen's group
* Received two possible datasets
* Created Research Territory Mapping
* Finished literature draft
